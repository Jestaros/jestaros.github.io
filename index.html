        <div class="Ily">
            <p class="Texting para1">Before I never would have thought in a million years that I'd fall in love with someone as perfect as you, someone where my heart beats a little extra fast with them, but you- you make it so easy to think about it now, you make it so easy to love you. You've won over my heart, and will always have a key to the deepest, most sensitive area of my heart, because I know in your hands you'd decorate my life exactly like you already have. You've brightened my life Yogi, when I first started to love you it felt so natural like my life had been for that one purpose, and while I was shy and nervous about it, you felt the same about me you showed me for the first time of many: that whenever I'm with you I know everything will work out, all of my wildest dreams like being in love with the perfect girl, comes true. You are my perfect girl, and while I'm sure if you traveled a year back and asked me if I'd ever be in love the answer you'd get would always be the same; "No." Now, I can confidently say you've changed me, not just with the things I didn't know I could like, or the things I didn't know I could do, but rather Me, as a person, now couldn't imagine a life without you. Yes, I've been in love, Yes I've found love, It's with the girl of my dreams, It's with you Yong Yi. You've make me the happiest boy in existance and I love that you love me, I love that I get you, I love that it's only you.</p>
            <p class="Texting para2">I can't predict the future, but I'm sure with you it'll continue to be this bright fairy tale, for as long as I have you to text, to holld, to hug, to love, to be with I'm sure Nothing in this world can keep me down, you've become the sun in my life, and while I'm still young, and inexperienced, while I'm still nervous and shy about expressing my love for you, I will always be your boy, I will always be with you, always be there for you, always be in love with you, and always desire you. You have got yourself a partner for life bucko! I'm always, always gonna be yours and yours only.</p>
            <p class="Texting para3">I remember the first time I knew I had fallen head over heels for you, it was when we went for boba and while I admit I was shy, doing something I've never done before, being somewjere I'd never been, you were there, supporting me every step walking with me every bit of the way. When I held your hand for the first time your touch was so soft in my palms, it made my head spin just being so close with you, having memories only we shared and then when I saw you again, the embrace still hasn't left my mind or my heart, I'll forever cherish those moments with you, even when I'm old and shrivled like a sphynx I'll still be able to recite verbatium every precious moment I had shared with you, from when you nurtured me when I was injuried, to when you held me when I was cold, to your nails in my head, your skin next to mine, everything just feels like a everlasting moment I could never forget.</p>
            <p class="Texting para4">Your compassion is unparallel, nothing in this world will compare or truly understand how much love you have in your heart, you cherish those around you, you cherish those you love, and I love you for that. Your constantly moving constantly driven to shine and it radiates off you. Your love as parent shows and I'm sure jake love every second he's with you. Your humor is so intoxicating and I find myself giggling uncontrollably in your pressence alone, I just love being with you, even if it's doing nothing, even if its sleep, even when its the most occtaine moments- aslong as I'm with you every and anything is better </p>
            <p class="Texting para5">I'll always be there for you, I'll always be your biggest cheerleader, I'll always dedicate my life, my time and my love to you, I'll always be yours, I'll always be your boy.</p>
            <p class="Texting para6">Yong Yi,</p>
