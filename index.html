        <title>Love letter to my baby!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>I don't know what to say, it's like a void in my heart without you, nothing feels the same, I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't function and I can't be happy. It hurts so much knowing, that I'm in pain because of you, and I have no one to talk about it besides you. Do you feel the same? Am I doing this all for theatrics? To sate my own hubris? Is this truly the end of us? That thought terrifies me, not solely because I miss and love you, but because I'm scared you won't even try, I'm scared that I'm writing this to express myself to no one but myself, I mean why would you even check this website again? Is what I'm doing weird? Will I look back at this and say "This was pointless, she never cared enough to check this."? I'm scared, I'm scared to think that but I'm even more scared to allow it to happen. Please if you ever read This, don't close you heart to me, don't let me think it was for no reason at all, please let me know that our love truly meant something to you.</p>
        <p>The day of, I slept, I slept hoping it was all a big dream, I slept hoping that I'd wake up with messages from you that reaffirmed our love, that never came; Instead it was, nothing, no text messages or notifcations from anyone, just silence on my phone which once had a purpose, now it feels like a tool to distract my thoughts.</p>
        <p>The next day, I cried, a lot, I cried away from my family, so no one would ask what was wrong, so no one would see me torn, It failed, my sister noticed and I told her everything, I showed her the messages and I let her read the conversation, rather, I begged her to read the conversation, I was hpping she'd validate you, condem me, make what you ere saying mean the absolute truth, but she pitied me, she told me I "handled" it well, she told me that you weren't being honest, but I didn't care, I tuned it out, I wanted to take your advice and validate your opinions. After reflecting a lot, and blaming, I started to take a step back, I put down the phone that I used to distract myself, you said I never expressed myself, but you never once had asked my about who I was, you never made me open up about my past or what made me who I am today? And honestly I blamed you for that, but in all that blaming I realized I did the same, I never sat down and had a conversation with my father, I never gave him the benefit of the doubt, I never gave myself a reason to dislike him. He was an abuser, he broken my mothers nose, ran over her feet, assaulted his children, all while being a wreckless alcholic who worked better alone. These were all the stories I had heard from my family, and he had the persoanlity when I met him to be true, but after our breakup I felt like I NEEDED someone to talk to. So I tried.</p>
        <p>I messaged him, the chat filled with miss calls from him, I wanted to see if this guy who we all knew was this terrible person would push me futher away, give me a reason to blame my lack of expression on, or maybe I just wanted actual advice from the person I was born with, I wanted him to push me away so I asked as followed:</p>
        <p>ME: "Do you regret anything?" HIM: "No" ME: "Has it ever hurt being without us?" HIM: "Yes, everyday"</p>
        <p>The third day, I wanted to crawl in a ball and stay there the rest of my life, I honestly was feeling suicidal (not anymore, this was only just a means to an end I guess), I had been reposting a lot, maybe so you'd notice to pain and come back, maybe our of spite since you were the person to tell me to repost more, regardless I reposted, a lot of sad stuff, a lot of songs, but even after all that, my phone was still silent, you had not messaged, infact no one had messaged, none of my friends I had met online, none of our friends we share mutuals with, no one, but what could I have expected? Would I not do the same thing? I had really given up, but the one person who did notice, was my cousin, whom many years older than me, whom I rarely ever spoke with, messaged me. It felt nice, finally someone cared, but it hurt so much when I immediately went to message you about it like an eager kid, only to remember, we don't have that relationship, and that hurt. I don't want to not talk to you, I don't want to not be in your life, I don't want to not make you smile, I don't want to not be the one who you come to when things weigh your mind, I don't want ANYONE to take that spot. But, do you? I'm often reminded, every step of the way, that even if I do change, even if we do get back together, even if all the cards fell perfectly, would you ever try your hardest for us? Those words hurt badly, they scarred deep, could you ever try your hardest for us? Or was I once again doing this all for theatrics?</p>
        <p>The fourth day, I decided I wanted to write all this, because I imagine you in your soft, well spoken, pefect voice reading this, and even if you disagree with everything I say here, that you still cared enough to read it. I love you, always will, even if you don't feel the same, I'll always be stupidly in love with you. As this day goes by I'll write my feelings to you, HOPING, pleading, begging you'll even just see it. I'm awaiting a call from my dad, hoping to see where it goes, I've already played the scenario of me moving in with him, getting a job, being at your birthday, living in kingston with you, and I've convinced myself that this is a possiblity, but I guess it depends on how the conversation goes. I decided to stop reposting, maybe delete social media all together, the reason to use it left after all.</p>

        <div class="Ily">
            <p class="Texting para1">Before I never would have thought in a million years that I'd fall in love with someone as perfect as you, someone where my heart beats a little extra fast with them, but you- you make it so easy to think about it now, you make it so easy to love you. You've won over my heart, and will always have a key to the deepest, most sensitive area of my heart, because I know in your hands you'd decorate my life exactly like you already have. You've brightened my life Yogi, when I first started to love you it felt so natural like my life had been for that one purpose, and while I was shy and nervous about it, you felt the same about me you showed me for the first time of many: that whenever I'm with you I know everything will work out, all of my wildest dreams like being in love with the perfect girl, comes true. You are my perfect girl, and while I'm sure if you traveled a year back and asked me if I'd ever be in love the answer you'd get would always be the same; "No." Now, I can confidently say you've changed me, not just with the things I didn't know I could like, or the things I didn't know I could do, but rather Me, as a person, now couldn't imagine a life without you. Yes, I've been in love, Yes I've found love, It's with the girl of my dreams, It's with you Yong Yi. You've make me the happiest boy in existance and I love that you love me, I love that I get you, I love that it's only you.</p>
            <p class="Texting para2">I can't predict the future, but I'm sure with you it'll continue to be this bright fairy tale, for as long as I have you to text, to holld, to hug, to love, to be with I'm sure Nothing in this world can keep me down, you've become the sun in my life, and while I'm still young, and inexperienced, while I'm still nervous and shy about expressing my love for you, I will always be your boy, I will always be with you, always be there for you, always be in love with you, and always desire you. You have got yourself a partner for life bucko! I'm always, always gonna be yours and yours only.</p>
            <p class="Texting para3">I remember the first time I knew I had fallen head over heels for you, it was when we went for boba and while I admit I was shy, doing something I've never done before, being somewjere I'd never been, you were there, supporting me every step walking with me every bit of the way. When I held your hand for the first time your touch was so soft in my palms, it made my head spin just being so close with you, having memories only we shared and then when I saw you again, the embrace still hasn't left my mind or my heart, I'll forever cherish those moments with you, even when I'm old and shrivled like a sphynx I'll still be able to recite verbatium every precious moment I had shared with you, from when you nurtured me when I was injuried, to when you held me when I was cold, to your nails in my head, your skin next to mine, everything just feels like a everlasting moment I could never forget.</p>
            <p class="Texting para4">Your compassion is unparallel, nothing in this world will compare or truly understand how much love you have in your heart, you cherish those around you, you cherish those you love, and I love you for that. Your constantly moving constantly driven to shine and it radiates off you. Your love as parent shows and I'm sure jake love every second he's with you. Your humor is so intoxicating and I find myself giggling uncontrollably in your pressence alone, I just love being with you, even if it's doing nothing, even if its sleep, even when its the most occtaine moments- aslong as I'm with you every and anything is better </p>
            <p class="Texting para5">I'll always be there for you, I'll always be your biggest cheerleader, I'll always dedicate my life, my time and my love to you, I'll always be yours, I'll always be your boy.</p>
